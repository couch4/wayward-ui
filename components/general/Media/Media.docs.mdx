## Proposed new schema;

We're currently assessing the data schema for this component going forward. It's currently aligned with Zaha's back end, but
the proposed schema is below;

<ShowJSON data={proposedSchema} collapsed={false} />

<br />

## Props

<Controls exclude={['style']} />

<br />

## Stories

### Media - Image

Images are rendered with Next's Image component and are rendered **responsive** by default. Meaning they will fill the specified container.
This comes in handy in responsive layouts and prevents content layout shift.

One thing to note, is that due to the image component being **absolute** you'll just have to ensure that <span style={{color:"pink"}}>**.media-holder**</span> is set to responsive. Generally a global utility class sets this for us.

The image component is processed by the **useImageOptimser** hook and also features a server action to fetch a blurred placeholder image.
To disable this behaviour, set the **disablePlaceholder** prop to true.

<Canvas of={MediaStories.MediaImage} sourceState="shown" exclude={['style']} />
<br />
### Media - Video

Videos are fetched and rendered with
[React-Player](https://github.com/cookpete/react-player). Currently if
**allowFullscreen** is set to true, the video will be rendered in fullscreen. If
set to true, then autoPlay won't work and vice versa.

There are also a bunch of buttons that can be exposed by CSS (and assigned an SVG, for example) in the <span style={{color:"pink"}}>**.video-controls**</span> class.
